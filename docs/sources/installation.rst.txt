Installation
============

In this chapter, we will discuss the steps necessary to compile and
install Mychem.

-  :ref:`How to Obtain Mychem` - mainly concentrates on
   downloading the last stable version of Mychem.

-  :ref:`Requirements` - lists the programs and libraries
   which you need installed to successfully compile Mychem.

-  :ref:`Compilation and Installation` - leads you through
   all the steps of compilation and installation of the application.

-  :ref:`Mychem API` - tells how to build the API documentation of
   Mychem.

Requirements
------------

In order to successfully compile and install Mychem, you need the
following programs and libraries.

-  C/C++ compiler

   The compilation has been tested successfully with the GNU C Compiler
   (GCC).

-  CMake version 2.6.0 or higher.

   CMake is a multi-platform Makefile generator. It is a Free Software
   and can be downloaded on the `CMake website <http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Index.html>`_.

-  MySQL version 4.0 or higher, or MariaDB.

   The MySQL database server is available from the `MySQL website <http://www.mysql.org>`_.
   The MySQL headers are also
   required for the compilation. They are included with the standard MS
   Windows installation of MySQL. For Linux, an additional package has
   to be installed (libmysqlclient-dev).

-  Open Babel version 2.3.2 or any later version. The compilation of
   Mychem requires also the openbabel header. For MS Windows, they are
   provided with the source package. For Linux, install the
   libopenbabel-dev package.

   The software is available from the `Open Babel Home Page <http://openbabel.sourceforge.net/wiki/Main_Page>`_.

How to Obtain Mychem
--------------------

The stable versions of Mychem are released as a tarball that has to be
extracted and compiled. The code can also be directly retrieven by
cloning the mychem-code GIT repository. The following sections
describe how to proceed.

Source Archive
++++++++++++++

The last stable version can be found on the `Mychem GitHub release page
<https://github.com/mychem/mychem-code/releases>`_. It is provided as
ZIP and compressed TAR archives. The last stable version is v1.0.0.

GIT Repository
++++++++++++++

The last development version of Mychem can be obtained by cloning the
`mychem-code GIT repository <http://github.com/mychem/mychem-code>`_. In case you
are using a command line interface, follow this step:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/mychem/mychem-code.git

Compilation and Installation
----------------------------

This section describes the compilation of Mychem's source code for
GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.

Compiling and Installing Mychem on GNU/Linux
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The compilation and installation instructions of the Mychem software
on GNU/Linux is detailed in the two following parts.

Standard Installation on GNU/Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This part describes the standard way to compile and install Mychem on
GNU/Linux. You have to check that the header files for the MySQL library
and the Open Babel library are installed on your workstation. If they
are not installed, the CMake software will raise an error when
generating the Makefile. First, extract the appropriate source package.
If you are using a command line interface, follow this instructions:

-  For the tar gzipped archive:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ tar -xfzv mychem-1.0.0.tar.gz

-  For the zip archive:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ unzip mychem-1.0.0.zip

CMake can build the libraries and executables into any directory. If the
directory contains the source, the build is called *in source*. In other
cases, it is called *out of source*. CMake strongly recommends and
promotes building out of source.

-  In source build:

   .. code-block:: bash


       $ cd mychem-1.0.0
       $ cmake .
       $ make
       $ sudo make install

-  Build out-of-source (recommended):

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ cd mychem-1.0.0
       $ mkdir build
       $ cd build
       $ cmake ..
       $ make
       $ sudo make install
       $ cd ..

   **Note**

   The default installation directory can be retrieven with the
   following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ mysql_config --plugindir
       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mariadb18/plugin

Once the library is installed, the SQL functions are created with the
following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mysql -u user -p < src/mychemdb.sql

**Note**

On Mac OS X and Windows, another SQL file is used instead of the
``src/mychemdb.sql`` file. The name of this file is detailed in the
corresponding OS section.

Customized Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can customized the build and installation process by modifying CMake
arguments. For example, if you want to change the path of the
installation directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /path/to/mychem/build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/convenient/path ..

If you want to have more details about the compilation process, use the
following option for the ``make`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make VERBOSE=1

Ubuntu specifities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AppArmor is a Linux Security Module and is installed by default on
Ubuntu. It permits to confine individual programs to a set of listed
files. To configure correctly AppArmor for Mychem, please follow the
instructions detailed in the :ref:`AppArmor` section.

Testing the installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since v0.5, Mychem includes a test suite. To build and use these
programs, you have to set the MySQL connection settings and run the
tests. The following example builds Mychem out-of-source and enables
testing.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd mychem-1.0.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DMY_HOST=localhost -DMY_USER=user -DMY_PASSWD=passwd ..
    $ make
    $ make install
    $ cd ..

When running the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cmake -DMY_HOST=localhost -DMY_USER=user -DMY_PASSWD=passwd ..

You will see the following line in the status message:

::

    -- Test module enabled

The program use the *mysql* database for testing. If the *user* do not
have access to this database, it is possible to set the name of the
database by using the -DMY_DB option.

    **Note**

    If the user can access MySQL without a password, then you do not
    need to set the ``MY_PASSWD`` parameter. The two other parameters (
    ``MY_HOST`` and ``MY_USER``) are mandatory.

    **Note**

    The password is not stored in a safe location. If you are doing
    tests on a critical server, please use directly the test executables
    and do not use the CMake facility to perform the tests ! You can
    find the test executables in the ``/path/to/mychem/build/tests``
    directory.

To run the tests, use the command ``make test``. You should see the
following results:

::

    Running tests...
    Test project mychem-code/build
        Start 1: ConversionTest
    1/5 Test #1: ConversionTest ...................   Passed    0.05 sec
        Start 2: HelperTest
    2/5 Test #2: HelperTest .......................   Passed    0.00 sec
        Start 3: ModificationTest
    3/5 Test #3: ModificationTest .................   Passed    0.01 sec

        Start 5: PropertyTest
    5/5 Test #5: PropertyTest .....................   Passed    0.03 sec

    100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 5

    Total Test time (real) =   0.14 sec

The ``LastTest.log`` file contains more details about the test results.
It can be found in the ``/path/to/mychem/build/Testing/Temporary``
directory.

Installation Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building your application can raise some errors:

-  If CMake returns the following error:

   ::

       CMake Error: This project requires some variables
       to be set, and cmake can not find them. Please set the following
       variables: OPENBABEL2_INCLUDE_DIR (ADVANCED) OPENBABEL2_LIBRARIES
       (ADVANCED)

   It means that CMake did not find Open Babel. If you know where Open
   Babel is installed on your system, you can tell it to CMake with:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ cd /path/to/mychem-1.0.0/build
       $ cmake -DOPENBABEL2_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/openbabel/include \
       -DOPENBABEL2_LIBRARIES=/path/to/library ..

Installing Mychem on Mac OS X
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The installation on Mac OS X differs slightly from an installation on
GNU/linux. First, you have to set some parameters for CMake. The
following list shows common values used when compiling Mychem on Mac OS
X. Note that these values may differ on your system.

+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| CMake Variable         | Value                                                         |
+========================+===============================================================+
| OPENBABEL2_INCLUDE_DIR | ``/usr/local/include/openbabel-2.0``                          |
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| OPENBABEL2_LIBRARIES   | ``/usr/local/lib/libopenbabel.dylib``                         |
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| MYSQL_INCLUDE_DIR      | ``/Library/MySQL/include/mysql``                              |
+                        +---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        | ``/Applications/MAMP/Library/include/mysql``                  |
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| MYSQL_LIBRARIES        | ``/Library/MySQL/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.dylib``             |
+                        +---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        | ``/Applications/MAMP/Library/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.dylib`` |
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Once the library is installed, the SQL functions are created with the
following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mysql -u user -p < src/mychemdb_macosx.sql

When executing the previous command, you can have the following problem:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mysql -u root -p < src/mychemdb_macosx.sql
    Enter password:
      ERROR 1126 (HY000) at line 10: Cannot open shared library 'libmychem.dylib'
      (errno: 2 dlopen(/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin/libmychem.dylib, 2): Library
      not loaded: libmysqlclient.18.dylib
      Referenced from: /usr/local/m)

This problem can be fixed by modifying the libmychem.dylib shared
library so that all dependent libraries contain the correct path
information:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ otool -L libmychem.dylib
    libmychem.dylib:
            /usr/local/lib/libmychem.0.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current
            version 1.0.0)
            /usr/local/lib/libopenbabel.4.dylib (compatibility version 4.0.0,
            current version 4.0.1)
            libmysqlclient.18.dylib (compatibility version 18.0.0, current version
            18.0.0)
            /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current
            version 159.1.0)
            /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current
            version 52.0.0)
    $ sudo find / -name 'libmysqlclient.18.dylib' -print
    Password:
    /usr/local/mysql-5.5.24-osx10.6-x86_64/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib
    $ sudo install_name_tool -change libmysqlclient.18.dylib \
     /usr/local/mysql-5.5.24-osx10.6-x86_64/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib \
     libmychem.dylib

Installing Mychem on Microsoft Windows
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section describes contains the installation of Mychem on Microsoft
Windows.

Installation using Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2005
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can compile Mychem with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition (
MSVC++ ). This software can be downloaded from the `Microsoft MSDN
Website <http://www.microsoft.com/express/2005/>`_. To complete the
Microsoft Visual C++ software, install the SDK Platform. The instruction
are given in the following
`article <http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235626(VS.80).aspx>`_.
The MySQL package for Windows contains all required libraries and
include files for building Mychem. However, Open Babel does not provide
such a package. You have to compile Open Babel. It can easily be done
with MSVC++ and by following the instructions detailed on the `Open
Babel Website <http://openbabel.org/wiki/Install_%28MSVC%29>`_. The
following libraries are necessary for the build of Open Babel. They can
be downloaded from the `Maintainer's Home
Page <http://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml>`_ of the libxml2 Windows
port.

-  iconv

-  libxml2

-  zlib

Once your compilation environment is ready, you can generate the MSVC++
project file with CMake. Launch the CMake GUI and set up the source code
directory and the build directory for the binaries.

.. image:: images/cmake1.png
   :alt: CMake screenshot 1

Then, click on Configure. A window will appear to let you select what
build system you want CMake to generate files for. Choose Visual Studio
8 2005 and click on Ok. After some processing, CMake will raise an error
window, telling you that some variables are not founded. You will have
to set it manually. Press twice the Ok button. Click on the Show
Advanced Values checkbox to display the full list of parameters. Find
the lines with OPENBABEL2_INCLUDE_DIR, OPENBABEL2_LIBRARIES,
MYSQL_INCUDE_DIR, MYSQL_LIBRARIES values. These lines are at the end
of the list.

.. image:: images/cmake2.png
   :alt: CMake screenshot 2

You have to set OPENBABEL2_INCLUDE_DIR to the directory ``include``
contained in the Open Babel source directory (i.e.,
``C:/path/to/openbabel/include``) and OPENBABEL2_LIBRARIES to the file
named ``OpenBabelDLLD.lib`` (the library should be located in the
``C:/path/to/openbabel/windows-vc2005/OpenBabelDLL/Debug`` directory).

The MYSQL_INCLUDE_DIR and MYSQL_LIBRARIES parameters should be
respectively set to ``C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y\include`` and
``C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y\opt\libmysql.lib``, where X.Y is the version of MySQL.

Once the values are set, click on Configure and then on Ok. CMake
generates the MSVC++ project file (``mychem.sln``) and exit.

.. image:: images/cmake3.png
   :alt: CMake screenshot 3 

Once the project file is generated, open it with MSVC++ . The
``mychem.sln`` project file should be located at
``C:/path/to/mychem/build/``. Several modules are available for
building, however, only *mychem-lib* is required:

-  mychem-lib

-  conversion_test

-  helper_test

-  modification_test

-  molmatch_test

-  property_test

If you build the *debug* version of Mychem, the Mychem DLL file is
located in the ``C:/path/to/mychem/build/dir/src/debug`` directory and
is named ``mychem.dll``. You have to copy this DLL file into the MySQL
``bin`` directory. Then copy the
``C:/path/to/openbabel/windows-vc2005/OpenBabelDLL/Debug/OpenBabelDLLD.dll``
DLL file and all DLL files founded into the
``openbabel-2.400/windows-vc2005`` directory to the MySQL ``bin``
directory.

At last, restart MySQL and run the win32 SQL script
``/path/to/mychem/src/mychemdb_win32.sql``.

Mychem API
----------

API documentation is available on the `Mychem
website <http://mychem.sourceforge.net/api/index.html>`_.

You can also build the documentation yourself, by using the `Doxygen
software <http://www.doxygen.org/>`_. To generate this documentation,
use the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /path/to/mychem-1.0.0
    $ mkdir api
    $ doxygen Doxyfile

The API documentation can be read using a web browser at the following
url: ``file:///path/to/mychem-1.0.0/api/html/index.html``
