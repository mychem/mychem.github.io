Introduction
============

Mychem
------

Mychem is a chemoinformatics extension for MySQL and MariaDB. This
extension provides a set of functions that handles chemical data stored
in a database (i.e. file format conversion, chemical properties
computation, ...). These functions are provided through the UDF
mechanism, making them usable like native MySQL functions.

Mychem is based on Open Babel (version >= 2.3.2). As Open Babel is a
well-known software in chemoinformatics, Mychem proposes reliable and
fast functions. These functions permit you to search, analyze and
convert chemical data.

More informations about Mychem are available on the `Mychem
website <http://mychem.github.io/>`_.


MySQL and MariaDB
-----------------

MySQL is one of the most popular Open Source SQL database servers. It is
a very fast, multi-threaded multi-user and robust application. MySQL
Server is intended for mission-critical, heavy-load production systems
as well as for embedding into mass-deployed software. Further
informations about MySQL can be founded on the `MySQL
website <http://www.mysql.com>`_. MariaDB is a fork of MySQL.


Open Babel
----------

Open Babel is a chemical toolbox designed to speak the many languages of
chemical data. It is an open, collaborative project allowing anyone to
search, convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling,
chemistry, solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related areas. You
can find more informations about Open Babel on the `Open Babel
website <http://openbabel.sourceforge.net/wiki/Main_Page>`_.
